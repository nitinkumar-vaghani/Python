# Python
  Learn Python as beginner and can become expert 

## **Phase 0: Python Learning Foundation (Before Project Development)**

### **Duration:** 10–14 days (2–3 hrs/day)

### **Goal:** Build comfort with modern Python (3.12+), async programming, and the ecosystem you’ll use with FastAPI.

---

### **Step 1. Python Core Syntax & Concepts (3–4 days)**

Focus on differences from PHP, and how Python handles data, OOP, and modules.
**Topics:**

* Variables, data types, and basic operations
* Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
* Conditionals and loops
* Functions, arguments, scope
* Modules, imports, packages
* Exception handling (try/except/finally)

**Mini project:**
Write a simple CLI-based calculator or file parser.

---

### **Step 2. Intermediate Concepts (3–4 days)**

These are the essentials you’ll directly use in FastAPI & ORM work.
**Topics:**

* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, composition)
* Type hints & Python typing system
* File handling (JSON, CSV, text)
* Virtual environments (`venv`, `poetry`)
* Decorators (basic understanding)

**Mini project:**
Build a small class-based script (e.g., “UserManager” with CRUD in-memory).

---

### **Step 3. Asynchronous Programming (2–3 days)**

FastAPI heavily relies on async I/O.
**Topics:**

* `async` and `await` keywords
* Event loops and `asyncio` basics
* Running async tasks concurrently

**Mini project:**
Write a small async script to fetch data from multiple APIs using `aiohttp`.

---

### **Step 4. Working with Databases & APIs (2–3 days)**

Before jumping into Snowflake or FastAPI, get used to SQLAlchemy and API calls.
**Topics:**

* SQLAlchemy ORM basics (models, sessions, queries)
* Connecting to SQLite or PostgreSQL locally
* Using `requests` and `httpx` for APIs
* Pydantic basics for data validation

**Mini project:**
Build a script that fetches weather data and stores it in a local DB.

---

### **Step 5. Testing & Code Style (1–2 days)**

Develop good habits early.
**Topics:**

* Writing unit tests with `pytest`
* Code formatting using `black`
* Linting with `flake8`
* Type checking with `mypy`

**Mini project:**
Add tests to your weather script or user manager.
